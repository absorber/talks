# How to strace

```
$ strace google-chrome
execve("/usr/bin/google-chrome", ["google-chrome"], [/* 51 vars */]) = 0
brk(0)                                  = 0x124f000
access("/etc/ld.so.nohwcap", F_OK)      = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)

page about him by USHistory.org of Graeme Park." I cannot quite
figure out what this means, but I am guessing that it means the
uploader took this image from a page hosted on USHistory.org. A
painting of a man who lived in the mid-18th century is likely to be
the public domain, as claimed, but we have no good source", 512, 0,
